============Description of the program============

Kitchen Kalc is a program that allows users that bake or cook to conveniently take a recipe and change the serving size to their needs. Given the url to a recipe, we will calculate the needed quantity of ingredients for the new serving size inputted by the user. 

When they first enter the app, they will see a page with an input section and a button, in which they will input a website of a recipe from one of the following cooking websites:

- www.bettycrocker.com
- www.geniuskitchen.com
- www.foodnetwork.com
- www.marthastewart.com

============Inspiration========================

It is always annoying when we find a recipe to cook or bake, but it does not have the right serving size to fit our needs We thought it would be nice to have a program that will take care of doing the converting.

============Why Is It Useful?============

It allows users to get accurate conversions based on their desired serving size without having to calculate anything themselves
